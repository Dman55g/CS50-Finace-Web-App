## Description:

This is a finance app created using the Flask framework for Python. I worked on it while taking CS50x. It is a simple web app that allows you to create or log into an account. You can then look up a real-world stock price using Yahoo Finance API. In the web app, you can also buy, sell, and track your stock. All the information is stored in a SQL database and passwords are encrypted. None of the money and transactions are real it is a simple demonstration. The majority of the code was written by myself but parts of it were written by the CS50 team at Harvard.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This isn't a live web app, none of the money or transactions are real, this project is a demonstration of my skills and educational purposes.

## Motivations

The main motivation for this project was because it was an assignment for CS50. My other motivation behind it was to be able to improve my skills by making a functional backend. I also wanted to make something practical to mirror real-world use cases.

## üöÄ Quick Start

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You will need [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.11+ to run this program
> <sub>_3.10 and bellow may work but is untested_</sub>
